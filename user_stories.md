# marketing:
would like to have people review items to see what is popular.
we want:
* the focus group to view three image items, side-by-side.
* have them choose 1 item to select out of the three.
* record which image they chose.
* have them select different images 25 times.
* compile a report for those selected images to see which were more popular.

# the dev: 
would like:
* simple user freindly for the focus group
* record the information into something useable for marketing guys
* have the loop stop after 25 decisions/clicks
* gather how many images have how many clicks
* have the images not repeat after selection

# focus group:
would like to:
* click on image that they like the most.
* know when to stop choosing images.
* have a decent looking site that's pretty straight forward.
